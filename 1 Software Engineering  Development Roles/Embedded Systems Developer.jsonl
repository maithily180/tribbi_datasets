{"question":"What is the CAN protocol?","answer":"CAN (Controller Area Network) is a multi-master broadcast serial bus standard for connecting electronic control units (ECUs). It enables reliable, real-time communication without a host computer, primarily used in automotive systems to reduce wiring complexity, and also in industrial automation and medical equipment.","difficulty":"easy","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What type of protocol is CAN?","answer":"CAN is a message-based protocol, not address-based. Messages are broadcast with a priority and data content, and each node decides whether to process or discard them based on the identifier, allowing flexible communication to one or multiple nodes.","difficulty":"easy","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is bit stuffing in CAN, and why is it used?","answer":"Bit stuffing in CAN involves inserting a stuff bit of the opposite value after five consecutive bits of the same value (0 or 1) in NRZ-5 encoding. This ensures a signal edge for receiver synchronization, preventing clock drift between nodes.","difficulty":"medium","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is arbitration in CAN, and how does it work?","answer":"CAN arbitration is a non-destructive bitwise process where nodes transmitting simultaneously compare identifiers.

{"question":"What is the difference between Standard and Extended CAN?","answer":"Standard CAN uses an 11-bit identifier, while Extended CAN uses a 29-bit identifier (11-bit base + 18-bit extension). The Identifier Extension (IDE) bit is dominant (0) for Standard and recessive (1) for Extended. Standard frames have higher priority if the first 11 bits match.","difficulty":"medium","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is the role of the CAN transceiver?","answer":"The CAN transceiver interfaces between the CAN controller and the physical bus, converting digital signals to differential signals for transmission and vice versa, ensuring reliable communication over the bus.","difficulty":"medium","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What are the different types of CAN frames?","answer":"CAN frames include: Data Frame (carries data), Remote Frame (requests data), Error Frame (signals errors), and Overload Frame (requests delay). Data and Remote Frames are most common, with Data Frames carrying up to 8 bytes.","difficulty":"easy","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is the use of bit recessive and dominant in CAN?","answer":"In CAN, dominant bits (0) override recessive bits (1) on the bus.

{"question":"What is the maximum baud rate in CAN?","answer":"Standard CAN supports baud rates up to 1 Mbps, defined by the CAN controller’s clock and bit timing settings. CAN-FD extends this to higher rates (e.g., 5 Mbps) for faster payloads.","difficulty":"medium","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What are the error types in CAN?","answer":"CAN errors include: Bit Error (mismatch in transmitted/received bits), Stuff Error (bit stuffing violation), CRC Error (CRC mismatch), Form Error (invalid frame format), and Acknowledgment Error (no ACK from receivers). These trigger error frames.","difficulty":"hard","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is the difference between active and passive error states in CAN?","answer":"In Active Error state, a node detects errors and transmits Active Error frames (6 dominant bits) to notify others. In Passive Error state, a node with many errors transmits Passive Error frames (6 recessive bits) and may not disrupt the bus, reducing interference.","difficulty":"hard","topic":"CAN Protocol","role":"Embedded Systems Developer"}
{"question":"What is error confinement in CAN?","answer":"Error confinement tracks node errors using Transmit Error Counter (TEC) and Receive Error Counter (REC).

{"question":"What is the difference between CAN and CAN-FD?","answer":"CAN-FD (Flexible Data-Rate) extends CAN with up to 64-byte payloads (vs. 8) and higher baud rates (up to 5 Mbps vs. 1 Mbps).
